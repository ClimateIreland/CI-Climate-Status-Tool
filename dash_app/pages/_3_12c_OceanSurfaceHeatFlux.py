Surface heat flux is exchange of heat, per unit area, crossing the surface 
between the ocean and the atmosphere. Heat may be transferred into the ocean 
from the atmosphere or vice-versa. This heat transfer occurs in a number of 
different ways. Heat may be transferred through evaporation or condensation of 
water; it can be transferred directly by conduction and convection; it can be 
transferred into the ocean by direct radiation from the sun or back from the 
ocean by reflection or emission of energy to the atmosphere.

Surface heat flux has a strong influence on climate and is linked to floods and 
droughts, storm intensity and tracks.
