Seaweed, seagrass and coral abundance and condition are good indicators of 
marine health and are essential elements of the marine environment. As well as 
playing a role in the carbon cycle they provide crucial habitats for many fish,
 crustaceans and other species. However, they are under constant transformation
  in response to human activities and global change.

Seagrass is found close to coasts and is very vulnerable to human actions.

As part of Irelandâ€™s monitoring programme under the Water Framework Directive, macroalgae (seaweed) and seagrass communities are used as measures of biological quality and health in estuaries and coastal waters.  Macroalgal quality is assessed   by looking at seaweed diversity on rocky shores, and green algal growth.    Intertidal seagrass communities, which are a protected habitat, have been monitored by the EPA since 2007. 
 As part of a National Parks and Wildfire Service (NPWS) commissioned survey of the abundance and distribution of offshore cold-water reef habitat a set of coral habitat types has been identified on the Irish shelf, based on underwater observations from Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV). These include cold-water coral reefs, coral gardens and sea-pen fields. Records of the samples have been included in the Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs) database of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). 
A number of areas where deep-water corals were identified have been designated as   Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) by the NPWS.
