Soil moisture comprises only a tiny percentage of the total global water 
budget, but it has a key role in influencing the hydrological cycle and is a 
major driving force in the soilâ€™s ability to act as a carbon sink or source. 
Soil moisture content refers to the amount of water held in the soil and is 
affected by the soil texture, topography, land cover and weather conditions. 
Both local climate and vegetation influence soil moisture through 
evapotranspiration.
        """
bulletPoint1 = """
Soil moisture is a determinant of the type and conditions of vegetation in a 
region, and it is an important measure for agriculture, as it affects the 
length of the grazing season, grass and crop growth rates and nutrient uptake 
and loss.
