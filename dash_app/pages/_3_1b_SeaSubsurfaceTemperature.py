        The temperature of the ocean is influenced by a number of factors, including the amount of heat 
        from the sun transferred through the atmosphere to the water, surface and 
        subsurface circulation and current patterns. Heat uptake by the global ocean accounts for 
        more than 90% of the excess heat trapped in the Earth system in the past few decades.
