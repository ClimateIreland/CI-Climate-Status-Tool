Transient tracers are human-made chemical substances that have a known 
concentration history in the atmosphere. These substances are partly absorbed 
by the ocean and becomes dissolved in water. Their  measurement provides an 
insight into ocean processes. By measuring their presence in the subsurface 
of the ocean it is possible to estimate when the gas entered the ocean, how 
quickly it disperses and how it is transported by currents and into the deep 
ocean. Such knowledge also helps in understanding and quantifying the 
concentration and fates of other compounds such as anthropogenic carbon and 
nitrous oxide. Moreover, it improves knowledge of the overturning circulation 
of water masses in the ocean itself.

Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), themselves a 
powerful greenhouse gas, are a persistent industrial chemical whose 
atmospheric concentrations increased and then decreased after the signing of
