Methane (CH\u2084) is the third most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere after CO\u2082 and water vapour.   
Although estimated to have a global warming potential evaluated over 100 years of approximately 28 times that of CO\u2082, methane does not persist for much more than a decade in the atmosphere.  
Approximately 60% of methane emissions are due to human activities, the remaining 40% are due to natural processes.

In Ireland, agriculture contributes almost 93% of total CH\u2084 emissions, with the remainder due to waste management (5%) and the energy sectors.
