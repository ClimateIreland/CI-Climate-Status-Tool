        The ocean absorbs significant quantities of carbon through natural cycles 
        driven by ocean circulation, biogeochemistry and biology.  
        It is estimated that the ocean has absorbed between 20â€“30% of total anthropogenic CO2 
        emissions since the 1980s thereby reducing atmospheric accumulation and thus partially 
        mitigating global warming.
