Rainfall (precipitation) plays a vital role in the water cycle and water balance and is essential for the maintenance of life.   
An understanding of precipitation distribution and trends is essential for assessing potential effects of climate change on

Being a key indicator, precipitation has been measured systematically in 
Ireland since the late nineteenth century with a peak of over 800 rainfall
stations in the late 1950s. Currently precipitation is measured at the 25 
synoptic (red) and 57 climatological (blue) weather stations; in addition, 
there is a wide network of over 400 voluntary rainfall observers (yellow) 
(map 2.5). At the synoptic stations, readings are made continuously 
and reported on the hour; at climate and rainfall stations a daily 
precipitation total is recorded each day at 09:00 am. 
There are some gauges in remote locations which are read once a month.  
All precipitation data since January 1941 are available in digital format.
